# Computer Forensics Labs

This repository contains 16 lab assignments completed as part of a Computer Forensics course. The labs provide hands-on experience with forensic tools, procedures, and concepts related to digital investigations.

## Course Learning Outcomes

At the successful completion of this course, students should be able to:

1. Demonstrate the phases of proper forensic procedures: identification, preservation, collection, examination, analysis, and presentation.  
2. Utilize computer forensic tools to perform a forensic analysis of a suspected security incident.  
3. Demonstrate an understanding of the various laws dealing with computer forensic analysis.  
4. Understand the rules of evidence and the importance of the chain of custody.  
5. Understand the fundamentals and basic principles of computer forensics and crime scene analysis.  
6. Apply the principles and procedures of computer forensics in practical scenarios.

## Lab Summaries

| Lab | Summary |
|-----|---------|
| **Lab 1** | Introductory forensic tasks; may involve VM setup and basic forensics tools (content not yet reviewed). |
| **Lab 2** | Designed a digital forensics business plan, covering tools, services, policies, and startup planning (content not yet reviewed). |
| **Lab 3** | Performed data acquisition using FTK Imager, exploring evidence handling, image hashing, and forensic image creation. |
| **Lab 4** | Used OSForensics to investigate a USB drive image, performing file searches, case setup, indexing, and analysis. |
| **Lab 5** | Performed disk and Windows Registry analysis using FTK Imager and Registry tools to uncover system artifacts. |
| **Lab 6** | Used Hex Workshop to hide data in file slack space and securely wiped the virtual drive using DBAN, evaluating different wiping methods. |
| **Lab 7** | Collected live Linux system data using shell commands, explored hard and symbolic links, and conducted forensic analysis with Sleuth Kit and Autopsy. |
| **Lab 8** | Recovered manipulated image files and performed steganography using Autopsy, HxD, and Steghide tools. |
| **Lab 9** | Imported NSRL hash database into Autopsy, conducted hash-based validation of files, and experimented with bit-shifting obfuscation and recovery in WinHex. |
| **Lab 10** | Captured live memory from a VM using WinPmem, analyzed it in Volatility via OSForensics, and performed network forensics using Wireshark on a malicious PCAP file. |
| **Lab 11** | Recovered and analyzed email evidence using Autopsy and MXToolbox. Carved emails from a TAR file using WinHex and explored email header metadata. |
| **Lab 12** | Performed mobile device forensics on a Nokia device using Cellebrite Reader. Extracted SMS, contacts, images, and audio; generated a forensic report. |
| **Lab 13** | Conducted cloud forensics using OSForensics and WinHex. Analyzed Windows prefetch artifacts to extract runtime, modification time, and execution count. |
| **Lab 14â€“15** | Tagged and reported unauthorized applications in Autopsy. Prepared expert testimony by analyzing email artifacts and documenting chain of custody. |
| **Lab 16** | Scanned a forensic image for malware using Windows Defender. Investigated MFT corruption using WinHex to examine bit-shifted file entries and calculate absolute offsets. |
